# D3 Scatterplot Graph of Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing From Around 1994 to 2015

*__This is the code I wrote to pass the freeCodeCamp "D3 Scatterplot" challenge.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:** 

Hover over any plot, dot to see the fastest speed time, and the year it occurred.

**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
